### What you’re doing

You are going to open a Jupyter notebook in VS Code and run it successfully using the course Python environment.

### 1) Open the course folder in VS Code

1.  Open **VS Code**
2.  Go to **File → Open Folder…**
3.  Open your course work folder (example: `C:\cmsc-1217\`)

### 2) Install the extensions (if you don’t already have them)

In VS Code, install:

-   **Python** (Microsoft)
-   **Jupyter** (Microsoft)

### 3) Create the course Python environment and select it in VS Code (one-time)

#### 3A) Create the course environment folder

1.  Create a folder on your C: drive named:

    -   `C:\cmsc-1217-env\`

#### 3B) Create the virtual environment (.venv)

1.  Open **Command Prompt** (Windows search → type “Command Prompt”)
2.  Run:

``` bat
cd C:\cmsc-1217-env
python -m venv .venv
```

#### 3C) Activate the environment

In the same Command Prompt window, run:

``` bat
C:\cmsc-1217-env\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

You should see `(.venv)` appear at the start of the line.

#### 3D) Install the notebook packages (first-time setup)

Still in the activated environment, run:

``` bat
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

#### 3E) Select the environment in VS Code (Interpreter)

1.  In VS Code, press **Ctrl + Shift + P**
2.  Type **Python: Select Interpreter**
3.  Choose the interpreter that looks like:

-   `C:\cmsc-1217-env\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

If you don’t see it:

-   choose **Enter interpreter path…**
-   paste: `C:\cmsc-1217-env\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

This is the environment we will use all semester.

### 4) Open the notebook

-   In the Explorer panel, click the notebook file (`.ipynb`) your instructor provided.

### 5) Select the notebook kernel (first time only)

The first time you run a notebook, VS Code may ask you to pick a **kernel**.

Choose the kernel that matches the course environment path:

-   `C:\cmsc-1217-env\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

This can feel repetitive the first time. That’s normal. Once selected, it usually stays set for that folder.

### 6) Select the kernel, then run a quick test

1.  In the top-right of the notebook, click **Select Kernel**.

2.  Choose the kernel that points to the course environment:

    `C:\cmsc-1217-env\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

    (It may also show up as “Python 3.x (.venv)”—the key is that it points to `cmsc-1217-env\.venv`.)

3.  Click **+ Code**.

4.  In the code block that appears, paste:

``` python
print("Notebook is running")
```

5.  Run it by clicking the **Run (▶)** icon on the code block, or press **Shift + Enter**.
6.  You should see `Notebook is running` appear underneath.

### 7) Quick confirmation (your instructor may ask for this)

Run this in a cell:

``` python
import sys
sys.executable
```

It should show something like:

`C:\cmsc-1217-env\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

### If something goes wrong

-   If you see `ModuleNotFoundError` (missing package), you are almost always using the wrong interpreter/kernel.

    -   Re-do **Step 3** and **Step 5** and pick the one that points to `cmsc-1217-env\.venv`.
