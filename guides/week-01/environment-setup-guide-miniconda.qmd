### 1) Install Miniconda

**What you know from Structured:** you installed Python from **python.org**, and VS Code used that Python.

**What’s different here:** instead of installing Python directly, we install **Miniconda**, which is an environment manager. Think of Miniconda as a **tool that can install Python + data libraries into a self-contained folder** so this course has a consistent setup.

1.  Download and install **Miniconda (64-bit)**.
2.  During install, **do not add Miniconda to PATH**.

**Why not add to PATH:** you might already have a python.org install. We don’t want Miniconda to “take over” the `python` command everywhere on your machine. Instead, we’ll use the Miniconda/Anaconda Prompt when we want the course setup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2) Open the conda terminal

In the Start menu, open **Anaconda Prompt** (or **Miniconda Prompt**).

You should see something like:

`(base) C:\Users\yourname>`

**What `(base)` means:** you’re in conda’s default environment. It’s not “the class environment” yet—it’s just the starting point that lets you create one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3) Tell conda where to download packages from (channels)

Run:

``` bat
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

**Connection to what you know:** in Structured, you used `pip install ...` to download packages.

**Here’s the conda equivalent idea:** conda downloads packages from “channels,” which are like package stores/repositories. We point conda to **conda-forge** because it’s widely used and tends to work well for scientific/data packages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4) Create the course environment (your course-specific Python install)

Run:

``` bat
conda create -n pydata-book python=3.11
```

If it asks to proceed, type `y`.

#### What this does (important)

-   It creates a **new conda environment** named `pydata-book`.
-   Inside that environment, conda installs its **own copy of Python 3.10** plus the supporting pieces Python needs to run. (\[Wes McKinney\]\[1\])

#### Where this lives on Windows (so you can “see” it)

Miniconda installs into a folder on your machine (commonly something like):

-   `C:\Users\<yourname>\miniconda3\`

When you create an environment, it typically appears under:

-   `C:\Users\<yourname>\miniconda3\envs\pydata-book\`

That’s why later, when you run `sys.executable` in Jupyter, you see a path pointing into `miniconda3\envs\pydata-book\...`

#### About the name `pydata-book`

`pydata-book` is **just a name** for the environment—like naming a folder. It doesn’t “link” to the book in any technical way.

The book uses `pydata-book` as a convenient, descriptive name, so we keep it to match the book’s instructions and screenshots. You *could* name it `cmsc-1217`, but then your commands would differ from the book. (\[Wes McKinney\]\[1\])

#### Why Python 3.11 (when newer versions exist)

-   The book explicitly creates the environment with **Python 3.10**.
-   Python **3.11.0** was released **Oct 4, 2021**.
-   Newer versions do exist (for example Python **3.14** is a released series).

Could we use a newer version? **Probably**, but using the same version as the book is the “maximum compatibility” choice for Week 1 because:

-   you reduce the chance of version-specific differences,
-   and you avoid “my output looks different than the book” issues while students are still learning the workflow.

If later you decide to update, it’s a single change to the command (`python=3.12`)—but the conservative choice is to follow the text first and only change once you’ve tested it.

#### Note: the ToS prompt you hit

On some installs, conda may block downloads until you accept Terms of Service for certain channels. That’s what you saw. It’s enforced through Anaconda’s ToS tooling/plugin and can appear during `conda create` or `conda install`.

If the ToS message appears, follow the prompt it prints (it tells you exactly what command(s) to run), then re-run the `conda create ...` command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5) Activate the environment (switch into the course “Python machine”)

Run:

``` bat
conda activate pydata-book
```

You should now see:

`(pydata-book) ...`

#### Think of this like a virtual machine (but lighter)

In a virtual machine, you “switch into” a separate computer with its own software installed.

A conda environment is similar in spirit, but much smaller:

-   you’re switching into a **separate Python installation** with its **own packages**
-   it lives in a folder on your computer (not a whole virtual computer)

#### Why this matters

When the environment is activated, commands like these run *from the environment*:

-   `python`
-   `jupyter`
-   `ipython`

That means you’re using **the course Python + the course-installed tools**, not whatever else might be installed on your machine.

#### What happens if you forget to activate it

If you open a terminal and run `jupyter` **without** activating `pydata-book`, one of two things usually happens:

-   **`jupyter` is not recognized** This is common because Jupyter was installed *inside* the `pydata-book` environment, so Windows won’t see it unless that environment is active.

-   **OR it runs a different Jupyter** (less common, but possible) If you happened to install Jupyter somewhere else previously, you might accidentally run the wrong one.

Either way, the result is the same: you’re not using the course setup.

#### What about `python` — will it still work?

Usually, yes.

Because you installed Python in Structured (python.org), the `python` command may still work even when you are *not* in a conda environment.

But that Python (from Structured) will **not** automatically have the packages we installed into `pydata-book` (pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, etc.). That’s why the environment matters.

**Bottom line rule:** Before you run anything for this course, do:

``` bat
conda activate pydata-book
```

and confirm you see `(pydata-book)` in the prompt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6) Install the core course packages (inside the environment)

Run:

``` bat
conda install pandas=2.0.3 jupyter matplotlib
```

**Connection to what you know:** this is the conda version of `pip install ...`, but it’s often smoother for data libraries.

**What you’re installing:**

-   **pandas** = working with tables (DataFrames)
-   **matplotlib** = plotting
-   **jupyter** = notebooks (the main workspace for this course)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7) Create the course folder structure (so Jupyter stays organized)

Run these commands:

``` bat
mkdir C:\cmsc-1217
mkdir C:\cmsc-1217\course-work
mkdir C:\cmsc-1217\book
mkdir C:\cmsc-1217\data
```

#### What these folders are for

-   `C:\cmsc-1217\course-work\` This is your **workspace** for this class: your weekly notebooks, practice files, and anything you will submit.

-   `C:\cmsc-1217\book\` This is where the **pydata-book examples** will live. These are reference notebooks from the textbook’s companion materials. You generally won’t edit these directly unless instructed.

-   `C:\cmsc-1217\data\` This is where datasets go (CSV files, etc.) so your notebooks can load data from a consistent location.

#### Why this step exists

Jupyter shows you files based on the folder you launch it from. If you start Jupyter from your user folder (`C:\Users\...`), you’ll see everything on your computer and it gets messy fast.

By creating a dedicated course folder, you keep everything for CMSC-1217 in one place, and you can always find your work again.

**In the next step, we will launch Jupyter from `C:\cmsc-1217\course-work\` so that’s the first folder you see when the browser opens.**

### 7A) Install Git (only if you don’t already have it)

You should already have Git from **Structured Programming Logic**. This step is only for students who do **not** have Git installed.

1.  Open **Command Prompt** and check:

``` bat
git --version
```

2.  If you see a version number, you’re done.

3.  If you get an error like `'git' is not recognized`, install **Git for Windows** (use the ARM64 installer if available on your machine; x64 also works). After installing, open a new Command Prompt and run:

``` bat
git --version
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7B) Download the book files into your `book` folder (clone the repository)

Run:

``` bat
cd C:\cmsc-1217\book
git clone -b 3rd-edition https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book.git
```

This will create the folder:

`C:\cmsc-1217\book\pydata-book\`

These are the textbook’s companion notebooks and files. We keep them in the `book` folder so they stay separate from your own work in `course-work`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8) Start Jupyter Notebook in the correct folder (so you land in `course-work`)

Before launching Jupyter, move into your course work folder:

``` bat
cd C:\cmsc-1217\course-work
```

Then start Jupyter:

``` bat
jupyter notebook
```

A browser tab will open showing the contents of `C:\cmsc-1217\course-work\`.

#### Connection to what you know

-   In Structured, your “workspace” was **VS Code + terminal output**.
-   In this course, your “workspace” is the **Jupyter web interface**, where your instructions, code, and output appear together.

#### Important

Leave the terminal window open while you use Jupyter. That terminal is running the Jupyter server. If you close it, Jupyter will stop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9) Create your first notebook and run a quick confirmation

In the browser:

1.  Click **New → Python 3 (ipykernel)**
2.  In the first box, type:

``` python
import sys
sys.executable
```

3.  Run it with **Shift + Enter**

**What you’re checking:** you are running Python from the course environment. You should see something like:

`...\miniconda3\envs\pydata-book\python.exe`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10) Stop Jupyter when you’re finished

Go back to the terminal running Jupyter and press:

-   **Ctrl + C**, then type `y` if it asks to shut down

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Optional: IPython

**Connection to what you know:** this is like running Python in a terminal, but more helpful for exploration (history, tab completion, quick testing).

### Open an Anaconda tab (not PowerShell)

If you’re using **Windows Terminal**:

1.  Click the **small dropdown arrow** next to the plus (**˅**) *(Do not just click the + — that usually opens PowerShell.)*
2.  Click **Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)** *(or “Anaconda PowerShell Prompt (miniconda3)” — either works, but the Prompt is simplest)*

You should see a prompt like:

`(base) C:\Users\yourname>`

### Activate the course environment and start IPython

Run:

``` bat
conda activate pydata-book
ipython
```

You should then see:

`In [1]:`

### Exit IPython

Run:

``` python
exit()
```



### Optional: JupyterLab (modern web interface)

1. Activate the course environment:

```bat
conda activate pydata-book
```

2. Install JupyterLab (inside the environment):

```bat
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

3. Start JupyterLab **from your course-work folder**:

```bat
cd C:\cmsc-1217\course-work
jupyter lab
```

A browser tab will open and the file browser will start in:

`C:\cmsc-1217\course-work\`

**Important:** keep the terminal window open while you use JupyterLab (it’s running the server).
